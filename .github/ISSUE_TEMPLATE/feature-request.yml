        > 1. Check if there is an existing feature request that is similar to your on our Github.
        > 2. We encourage you to first discuss your idea on a [Github discussion](https://github.com/jrmatherly/apollos/discussions/categories/ideas).
        > This step helps in understanding the new feature and determining if it's can be implemented at all.
