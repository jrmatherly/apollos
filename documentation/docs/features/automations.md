# Automations

[Automations](https://app.apollosai.dev/automations) are a powerful feature within Apollos to schedule repeated jobs for Apollos to do on your behalf. Automations allow you run your query automatically at a scheduled time and frequency. Apollos will send its research to you as an email.
You can ask Apollos to create custom newsletters, summarize news, notify you of world events etc.

Apollos uses your local time zone for scheduling. You can configure, share and delete your automations from the [automations page](https://app.apollosai.dev/automations).

:::info[Self Hosting]
Self hosting users need to setup Resend and [Authentication](/advanced/authentication) setup to have Apollos send automation emails.
