# Chat

You can configure Apollos to chat with you about anything. When relevant, it'll use any notes or documents you shared with it to respond. It acts as an excellent research assistant, search engine, or personal tutor.

### Overview
- Creates a personal assistant for you to inquire and engage with your notes or online information as needed
- You can choose to use Online or Offline Chat depending on your requirements
- Supports multi-turn conversations with the relevant notes for context
- Shows reference notes used to generate a response

### Setup (Self-Hosting)
See [the setup guide](/get-started/setup.mdx) to configure your chat models.

### Use
1. Open Apollos Chat
    - **On Web**: Open [/chat](https://app.apollosai.dev/chat) in your web browser
    - **On Obsidian**: Search for *Apollos: Chat* in the [Command Palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette)
2. Enter your queries to chat with Apollos. Use [slash commands](#commands) and [query filters](/miscellaneous/query-filters) to change what Apollos uses to respond

#### Details
1. Your query is used to retrieve the most relevant notes, if any, using Apollos search using RAG.
2. These notes, the last few messages and associated metadata is passed to the enabled chat model along with your query to generate a response

#### Conversation File Filters
You can use conversation file filters to limit the notes used in the chat response. To do so, use the left panel in the web UI. Alternatively, you can also use [query filters](/miscellaneous/query-filters) to limit the notes used in the chat response.

Slash commands allows you to change what Apollos uses to respond to your query
