# Remote Access

By default self-hosted Apollos is only accessible on the machine it is running. To securely access it from a remote machine:
- Set the `APOLLOS_DOMAIN` environment variable to your remotely accessible ip or domain via shell or docker-compose.yml.
  Examples: `APOLLOS_DOMAIN=my.apollos-domain.com`, `APOLLOS_DOMAIN=192.168.0.4`.
- Ensure the Apollos Admin password and `APOLLOS_DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` environment variable are securely set.
- Setup [Authentication](/advanced/authentication).
- Open access to the Apollos port (default: 42110) from your OS and Network firewall.

:::warning[Use HTTPS certificate]
To expose Apollos on a custom domain over the public internet, use of an SSL certificate is strongly recommended. You can use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to get a free SSL certificate for your domain.

To disable HTTPS, set the `APOLLOS_NO_HTTPS` environment variable to `True`. This can be useful if Apollos is only accessible behind a secure, private network.
